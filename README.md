# CHI IT Academy

This project was created due to requairements, sended by email

## Developed Features

In the project, you can:

1. Load information from provided API:
To save data between page reload, I decided to save data in local storage, which I find this the best solution. If data was already downloaded, the app won`nt send any requests to get a data. To roll back changes, please clear the local storage.
2. Add item:
You can add items in the end of storage by clicking appropriate button and filling up inputs, provided by modal window.
3. Delete item:
You should press the delete button and submmit deleting item in the modal window.
4. Editing item:
You have only permit to change enabled inputs, such as:
- Color
- Price
- Availability
5. Search:
You can also search cars by selecting category from drop-down near the input, which you need to fill with category value for searching. Searching page will contain all searching results and button for returning to a home page.
6. Table provided with pagination, so you can easily list all items. The maximum of displayed items per page - 10. This can be changed in code.
7. Styles
For better view of application, I added some styles, icons for getting better experiance, using my app.
8. Preloader
Added preloader, while page is loading.
All requirements was fulfilled, and I`m looking forward for a positive feedback :)
